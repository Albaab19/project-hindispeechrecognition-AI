> Speech Emotion Recognition using AI
Description
This project focuses on building a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) system using Artificial Intelligence. The goal is to classify human emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral) from audio input. The repository contains the code for training and evaluating multiple AI models, including LSTM, SVM, VGGNet, and ResNet. The models were trained on two datasets:

RAVDESS: A publicly available dataset for English speech emotion recognition.

Self-made Hindi Dataset: A locally collected dataset for Hindi language emotion recognition (not shared in this repository).

Technologies Used
Python

Libraries: TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, Librosa, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Datasets: RAVDESS (English) and Self-made Hindi Dataset

Datasets
RAVDESS Dataset
The RAVDESS (Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song) dataset was used for training and testing. It contains 24 professional actors (12 male, 12 female) vocalizing two lexically-matched statements in a neutral North American accent. The dataset includes emotions such as happy, sad, angry, neutral, fear, surprise, disgust, and calm.

Self-made Hindi Dataset
A locally collected dataset was used for Hindi language emotion recognition. This dataset includes audio samples labeled with emotions such as happy, sad, angry, and neutral.

Note: This dataset is not shared in the repository due to privacy and licensing constraints.
